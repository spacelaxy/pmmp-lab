## PMMP LAB
PMMP Lab is a content series created by Spacelaxy Brazil focused on programming with PHP for the video game Minecraft, using the PocketMine software as the foundation. In this series, we’ll guide you through tutorials step by step, sometimes in a very simple way, and in other cases more advanced, and we’ll also show everything directly in the video, including the gameplay of our code in action!

## Mission
We aim to greatly expand the Minecraft Bedrock community in Brazil, which in turn helps many developers improve their understanding of programming logic, a subject that still lacks visibility in the country. Beyond Brazil, our goal is also to grow this community internationally. That’s why this description is in English, and everything you’ll see (except the videos themselves) will be in English as well.
